![webrtc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7e12b06-57c3-4e9b-b0f0-cc686bf04352)


This Real-Time Screen Sharing Application is built using modern web technologies such as WebRTC, PeerJS, React.js, and Node.js. The application allows users to share their screens in real-time, enabling seamless remote collaboration, presentations, and technical support sessions.

The app provides secure user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can initiate or join screen-sharing sessions. Each user is assigned a unique connection ID, which is used to establish peer-to-peer connections for screen sharing. The host can share their screen with a remote user, while the remote user has the option to share their screen back with the host. The application also supports real-time notifications for a smoother user experience.

##Key Features:
-**Secure User Authentication**: Users must log in to access the application, with hashed password storage for security.
-**Peer-to-Peer Connections**: Using WebRTC and PeerJS, the app enables direct, low-latency connections for screen sharing.
-**Screen Sharing**: Hosts and remote users can share screens in real-time, with full control over starting and stopping the share.
-**Password Reset Functionality**: Forgot password and reset password features are implemented using secure token generation and email notifications.
-**Admin Panel**: An admin can manage users, add new ones, and oversee the applicationâ€™s functionality.
-**Responsive User Interface**: The application has a clean and intuitive UI for a smooth user experience across devices.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, WebRTC, PeerJS
